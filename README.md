# The Game of Life 
###### greehill Frontend Developer Assignment

This is my implementation of the **most awesome assignment humankind has ever created**!

The features are:

âœ… User defined board size for the simulation 

âœ… Stat tracker for population size and generation number

âœ… Interactive grid to set up the 0th generation

âœ… The simulation can be cleared with a button

âœ… Simulation that can be started and paused as well as stepped forward with one step

âœ… Reset the board to the initial state to experiment on the initial 0th generation ðŸ§ª

âœ… NO godmode ðŸŒ©

âœ… Adjustable simulation speed with a slider

âœ… Random initial 0th generation with a button

**BONUS**

âœ…  Wide selection of emojis to be used as alive and dead cells for a visual change

I had a lot of fun working on this project! Thank you!
