# The Game of Life 
###### greehill Frontend Developer Assignment

This is my implementation of the **most awesome assignment humankind has ever created**!

The features are:

âœ… User defined board size for the simulation 

âœ… Stat tracker for population size and generation number

âœ… Interactive grid to set up the 0th generation

âœ… The simulation can be cleared with a button

âœ… Simulation that can be started and paused as well as stepped forward with one step

âœ… Reset the board to the initial state to experiment on the initial 0th generation ðŸ§ª

âœ… NO godmode ðŸŒ©

âœ… Adjustable simulation speed with a slider

âœ… Random initial 0th generation with a button

**BONUS**

âœ…  Wide selection of emojis to be used as alive and dead cells for a visual change

# How to play

1. Set the gameboard size you want ( default is 30x30 ).
2. Discover the different emojis you can set for the cells.
3. Choose "Random" and see what you get OR choose to start fresh with an empty board with "New Game".
4. Press Start to begin the simulation, but be sure to stop it any time you want to manually move the simulation to the next step, you can restart auto-play any time you want!
5. Change the simulation speed!
6. Watch the cells live and die.
7. Reset the board to the initial 0th generation to tinker with new setups or just start a new game with a random pattern or a blank board!

# Conclusion

I had a lot of fun working on this project! I still have ideas how it could be improved, I am thankful for the opportunity to create it as an assignment!
